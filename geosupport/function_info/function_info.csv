Extended: Latitude, Longitude, Blockface ID","Function 3 processes street segments and closely related three-street configurations. A street segment is a part of a street (called the 'on' street) between two consecutive cross streets.  For example, Madison Avenue (in Manhattan) between East 51st Street and East 52nd Street is a street segment.  Madison Avenue between East 51st Street and East 53rd Street is not a street segment, because there is an intervening street, East 52nd Street, between the given cross streets. An exception to the requirement that the input cross streets be consecutive along the 'on' street is the case of a T-intersection: Function 3 accepts as input a street configuration that defines the long blockface of a T-intersection.  (For precise definitions of the terms 'three-street configuration', 'street segment', and 'T-intersection', see Chapter VII.3.) A street segment intersecting with or lying on a borough boundary can be specified in terms of streets from both boroughs, by using the input fields Borough Code 2 and Borough Code 3, as described in Chapter VII.7.

The information returned by a successful Function 3 call includes two lists of street codes for all cross streets at the two intersections defined by the input streets;  and geographic area codes for the left and right sides of the street, such as the left and right community districts, ZIP codes, census tracts, etc.  'Left' and 'right' are defined relative to the 'on' street's 'logical direction', which in general is the direction of increasing address. The information also includes two items called the Segment Azimuth and the Segment Orientation that indicate how the street segment is oriented with respect to the points of the compass.  Applications can use either of these items to determine compass direction descriptors for the left and right sides of the street.  Another item, the Cross Street Reversal Flag, can be used to determine left and right relative to the order in which the input cross streets were specified.

3S,On Street and an Optional pair of any Intersecting Streets along the On Street,"Stretch-level data - Street Stretch information: List of intersecting streets in order along 'on' street, the distance between them and node IDs","Function 3S processes input street stretches. A street stretch is a portion of a street between any two cross streets.  If an input cross street intersects with the 'on' street twice, an input compass direction is required to identify which of the two intersections is intended. If the user application does not specify input cross streets, Function 3S returns information about the full length of the 'on' street.  Note that, in a Function 3S call, the input cross streets need not be consecutive along the 'on' street.

When successfully called Function 3S returns a list of all intersections in sequence along the 'on' street between (and including) the two intersections defined by the input 'on' and two cross streets, if any.  If the user has not specified input cross streets, the list contains all intersections in sequence from the beginning to the end of the 'on' street.  The sequence in which the intersections are listed accords with the direction of increasing addresses along the 'on' street.  Each intersection in the list is specified as a pair of street codes for two of the streets at that intersection. One of the street codes listed for an intersection may or not be the street code of the 'on' street. 

If the user requests Real Street Only output, only real street intersections are returned; Bends and Non-Street Features are not included in the list of intersections.

For each entry in the list of intersections of the street stretch, there are fields for a distance and a gap flag.  The distance is the approximate distance in feet between the given intersection and its predecessor in the list; the gap flag indicates whether the intersection and its predecessor are connected by the 'on' street. The gap flag also indicates the nature of the gap.  The first entry within a list will always have a zero in the distance field and a blank in the gap flag.
